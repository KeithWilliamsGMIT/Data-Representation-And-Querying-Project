# Data-Representation-And-Querying-Project

#### Description
This is my 3rd year project for my data representation and querying module for college. The aim of this project is to write a single page web application in Python using the Flask framework.

#### Planning Stage

The following is a list of goals I've outlined for this project.
+ Create a working SPA using best practices
+ Minimise response time
+ Experiment with new technologies
+ Write clear documentation and a user manual
+ Focus on developing a good UX
+ Deploy to a server

After considering the above goals I chose to develop a webapp similar to Twitter.

##### MVP
The MVP will only contain features vital to any social network. It should have a user friendly layout and should also be designed so that additional features will be easy to integrate. With this in mind I decided that the MVP should have five views.

1. Sign up and login views
   - The sign up and login will be very basic. There will be no email confirmation, forgot/reset password option or "remember me" option.
2. Feeds view
   - The feed view will allow users to write posts, but they can only be plain text, and to read other peoples posts.
3. Search view
   - Users can search for other people to follow.
4. Profile view
   - Display posts written by the user and the users details. There will be no user profile image in the MVP.

##### Additional features
The following are some of the features I'd like to add once the MVP is complete.
+ Add profile images
+ Allow users to comment, like and Share posts
+ Allow users to post images and videos
+ Recommend people to follow
+ Add a direct messaging system
+ Sign up and login options ommitted from MVP

#### Development Stage
Technologies used:
+ Python and Flask
+ Bootstrap
+ AngularJS
